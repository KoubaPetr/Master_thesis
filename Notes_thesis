Master thesis notes

Meeting with Roland Friday 19.10.:
The likelihood was wrong, instead of delta term in the likelihood,
there should be the survival up to that point exp[-sum(delta(a))].

further improvent achieved by trying different initial parameters

Then do the Pi Xi Square test (likelihood ratio), check the book
"Biometry" for this.

Meeting with Roland Monday 20.10:
- match of our survival model to the data is pretty good now, but still pchisq() test can be performed in order to find out whether higher polynomial could do even better job
-recommedation for further optimization packages: optimx, some more?
-Example of the pchisq() sent to mail:
	pchisq(2*exp(-52)/exp(-53),df=1,lower.tail=F)
	-check the input is correct (2*likelihoodratio)

Meeting with Roland Wednesday 24.10.:
-death rates look moreorless good - only the quartic deltas have a peak around age = 50, check whether it is supported by the data, maybe try to fit it with exponential instead
Now: -	look at the model provided by Roland, put in the delta for the uninfecteds, look what you 		get - for this get the animations fixed - done without animations
     -	MAYBE TRY TO PLAY AROUND WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND VIRULENCE TO GET THE DELTA FOR THE 		INFECTED POPULATION BASED ONLY ON RHE DELTA OF THE UNINFECTEDS - Try this fix now
     -	Does the model reflect, that the pathogen only gets transmitted after death?
     -  Think about the problem theoretically : done on paper!

Meeting Monday 5.11.:
	- The suggestions to correct the model were right
	- We can try to get the analytical solution of the PDE model. Its advantage is that it 		works even for unknown parameters. We can, however, learn the parameters from the data and 		in the simulation we should obtain similar results as in the analytical solution.
	-Summarize questions for Frida, to clarify the data and summarize what we did to ask her 	for suggestions what we might do further.

TODO:	-read the paper again, think of what we want to find out and pick the approach accordingly 		to our goals
	-this has lower priority, but I could still play around with the possibility of analytical 		solution to our model, refer to the book
		Mathematical Tools for Understanding Infectious Disease Dynamics

Tuesday 6.11.
- DONE:I have read the paper and the appendix again, summarized it in the latex file
- The paper might have useful references, check them out if it would be useful
- Napad na to podivat se na Poincarre recurrence theorem, checknout jakejch se tyka rovnic a jestli by to neslo pouzit na nejaky epidemiologicky modely
- Zkusit vymyslet navrhy co by mohlo byt nasim cilem!
- Kouknout na data a rozmyslet si otazky k nim
- Rozmyslet si otazky na Fridu Ben-Ami co by ji mohlo zajimat abychom zkoukli

Wednesday 7.11:
-Wrote down suggestions, sent to Roland, wait for feedback
Note to self:
Example:
Possible thing we could check: Paper \citep{Izhar_Ben_Ami_2} claims: "... The relationship between virulence and parasite transmission is believed to be a primary driver of the evolution of virulence, and it can be used to predict the optimal level of virulence [23]. Izhar and Ben-Ami [9] showed that this relationship is age-specific, because younger hosts produced more transmission stages than older ones even though parasite-induced \textbf{host mortality (virulence) did not vary with host age}..." We could try to check if we get a virulence which is constant with age.

Presentation to Frida 20th November:

- They have a paper (they will send it to us hopefully?), where they showed that the age moderates the pathogen strains competition, younger hosts enable coevolution of different strains whereas older host favor superinfection (?), this could potentially explain the positive corellation of R0 and delta - we could think about this

- For the maternal data we could use Little data (but they only meassured in young mothers... our mothers are older)

- we should keep in mind the different stages of the infection, if the infected dies shortly after infection it does not infect (we should keep in mind that only some proportion of the infecteds transmitt after natural death - how to estimate this proportion?)

-we should consider the age (or age at infection) dependence of burst b

-we have data on the population growth of pathogen within host, but the data dont have the age of death due to infection (because the Daphnia needs to be killed in order to count the spores), we could use it to estimate the population dynamics withni host and combine those withs with our data with ages of death due to infection and the sporecount at death to insvestigate the hypothesis with the deaths due to the pathogen threshold

-The pathogen Pateuria ramosa causes gigantism of the Daphnia (it also sterilizes it, so probably it forses it to use the spare resources for growth instead of for offspring) - logical since we dont have any vertical transmission

-They also have data for different pathogens, we could choose horizontal/vertical transmission (the vertical transmitted one probably doesnt cause gigantism and doesnt sterilize, right? That would nicely support the evolutionary arguments), they also have some pathogens which infect gradually (not only after host death)

-They would like to have our input for the design of the upcoming experiment, what would we like them to have meassured? (for example the size of the Daphnia w.r.t. the pathogen load that evolved within it)

Succesive discussion with Roland: Think of how to express the deathrate of infecteds, which might depend on both age and age at infection (but seems like it is only age dependent). Examine the dependency of virulance, and how to combine the virulence and the natural deathrate into the overall deathrate of infecteds (it might be just a sum, but it might be coupled... if v(AaI) and delta_natural(age), is it really the case that we dont have coupled terms age*AaI in the expresion of delta_overall(age,AaI)?

- Virulence seems to depend on the age at infection, could it be that because younger susceptibles are more susceptible, there is bigger competition between pathogens and they tend to be more lethal?

- Read survival analysis book, to figure out the hypothesis testing of the distributions (lifespans, survival...), using gamma distribution? Kolmogorov-Smirnov test?
-Show it is sufficient to use control instead of exposed (plots ready, show to Roland, discrepancy for aai=5 might be due to not enough data for exposed (16)), then use control instead of all the exposed in our virulence
-Try hypothesis testing to show virulence significantly depends on age at infection
-Read the papers from Frida and respond her

Meeting with Roland 18th of December
- to compare the virulences, we can also have a look into the log-rank test, but we should not rely on it blindly, since it might be different (survival analysis is dealing with slightly different cases)
- we should however try to compare the virulences using the Likelihood Ratio Test, use the baseline deathrate (from the control or uninfected population) add an quadratic Ansatz (for virulence) and fit it to the whole infected population, obtain one (or one set of) parameter, then repeat it for different age at infection groups, each yielding its own parameter (or set of parameters) and use LRT to account for the additional degree(s) of freedom, whether the difference is significant
- Continue writing the reports throughout the work, maybe try to write down everything formally straigt away, so it could be the final product already, finishing the thesis around middle of May is alright
-write abstract for prof. Sigrist and register for the thesis in mystudies
